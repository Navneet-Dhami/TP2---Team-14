<h3> Who we are </h3> 
At Soundwaves we aim to create an interactive and imaginative musical e-commerce site which provides a unique and enjoyable shopping experience for music lovers of all ages. This product offers a wide range of high-quality products, including record players, speakers, headphones, and CDs, accessible through a visually appealing and intuitive interface. The ultimate goal is to make discovering and purchasing music-related products as easy and enjoyable as possible while providing exceptional customer service and support. 

<h3> Technologies Used </h3> 
To achieve our goal, we developed the website using Spring Boot, which provides a flexible framework with easy integration of popular e-commerce libraries and tools for efficient development and deployment. Other languages that have been used in our project include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java and SQL.
